# This line does two things:
# - forces git to use LF
# - tell git to guess whether files are text or binary
* text=auto eol=lf

# Set the language for these files to json5 to ensure GitHub doesn't show the comments as errors
/.vscode/*.json linguist-language=JSON5

# Hide .yarn from GitHub's language detection
